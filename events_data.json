I believe I was told by God Himself in my darkest moment,  “But Jesus forgives sin”.  Looking back, I think this was the point when I made Jesus my “Saviour”  because there was nothing I could do about my sin. It took another a few years, to learn and understand that God  redeems sin - past, present and future, and could and would work it for my good and His glory (Romans 8:28, Isaiah 61:1-4).  I was ALL in! I surrendered my life to Jesus to be used for His eternal purposes. I now know this is what it means to make Jesus my “Lord”.  The Lord was and continued to be faithful to His sanctifying work and establishing my identity as His daughter over the next 20 years. I continually sought to serve Him - my passion and sweet spot being facilitating ladies Bible study, sharing what I was learning. But, there was more. Around turning 50, God began to show me my need for His healing love that deepens and seals a trusting relationship with Him; no doubts and fears about His sovereignty over my life no matter the stormy circumstances. This is the place of true rest for my soul. There are not enough words to express my gratitude.",
